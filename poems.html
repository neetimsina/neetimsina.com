							<h2>Living for Today</h2></center>
							<p><center>
Dirty dreams that led you to eloquence <br>
Will no more be there.<br>
You speak but you can not perform.<br>
The beautiful polish was just a garnish<br>
But there wasn’t anything to decorate.<br>
An emerald without the neck.<br>
A stunning house made up of paper,<br>
That flies with the slightest of wind.<br>
A chinaware inside the display case,<br>
That mom saves for the guest.<br>
The extra large coat we got as children,<br>
For a few more winters.<br>
The fruits that are just about to rot,<br>
we ate them today,<br>
Saving the fresh ones for tomorrow,<br>
Just to find them rotten as well.<br><br>

No, dear lord.<br>
We would rather have the clay, than the ceramics<br>
We would rather have a neck and try on cheap jewels.<br>
We would rather have an old wooden home.<br>
We would rather dine in our chinaware.<br>
We would rather get clothes that fit.<br>
We would rather buy less and eat fresh.<br>
We would rather dream than organize.<br>
We would rather live today.<br>

							<h2>Shame</h2></center>
							<p><center>
The shame in not loving <br>
Can’t be the same as in loving<br>
There are prophecies made<br>
But each of us falls in a different way<br>
We all are martyrs,<br>
Some happy some sad<br>
Some become martys even without knowing they died.<br><br>


Give me a rhythm of ignorance<br>
Pass me a naive gesture<br>
Show me the oceans you have saved for me<br>
I need to know<br>
The ocean won't turn into a tsunami someday<br>
Make me live in your darkness<br>
So I get habituated<br>
Stab me with the knife in your pocket<br>
Someday, you are gonna do it anyway.<br><br>

I am very strong.<br>
But I need not be strong in love. <br>
I need strength saved for some other compromise.<br> 
In Love,<br>
I need to bleed and heal<br>
And feel the shame again.<br>

							<h2>The Bridge</h2></center>
							<p><center>
								In the world of may bes and Ifs <br>
Life is grey <br>
But for bridges like me <br>
Its either this side or across <br>
A suicide or a dive <br>
Kill or die <br>
Danger lurks in the middle <br>
Hanging by thread <br>
Like love and promises. <br><br> 

All dried up last winter <br>
There is no river beneath me <br>
With merely a plain piece of abyss <br>
The longer as I stare at it <br>
It glances back to me in peace. <br><br>

Happy enough to carry people to their destiny <br> 
Sad enough to not have one of my own. <br>
I am a bridge in pain.<br>
Ready as they decide coming back <br>
To be wrecked all over again.<br>

							<h2>The song of solitude</h2></center>
							<p><center>
								The Pain subdues
After a while, it stops scaring you<br>
The constantly changing changes<br>
Makes life it’s second degree derivative<br>
Yet, you get through it,<br>
As you have been flying higher.<br><br>

Who did you expect to fight your battles?<br>
That’s not a battle for anybody else<br>
Just another ridiculous life choice.<br>
For a while, there are people who assure<br>
But nobody has your demons,<br>
Nobody has your dreams<br>
Most of them don’t have a dream to begin with.<br><br>

Everyday you think, this is the lowest it gets<br>
The next day life stoops even lower.<br>
Who sets the ground for tolerance?<br>
An old man once told you,<br>
“Your pain is my water, I drink it everyday<br>
Your expectations are my privilege, I yearn for it.<br>
Your pleasure must be what heaven looks like”.<br><br>

People, they are wonderful<br>
As long as you don’t keep them around.<br>
People drag people to their habits<br>
There is no Individuality in groups.<br><br>

You have got a rusty soul to begin with.<br>
Nobody greases their hands for nothing.<br>
In this ocean of solitude,<br>
A drop of fire extinguishes,<br>
A glint of ray hesitates<br>
A gesture of kindness disappears overnight.<br><br>

For this ocean of solitude,<br>
Which all of us begin after a point<br>
Submerges you to grow your wings,<br>
And call it a boon or a curse,<br>
The winner always stands alone.<br>
<br><br>

							<h2>Generation Gap</h2></center>
							<p><center>
								When things were scarce,<br>
								I learnt to save<br>
								When they were not<br>
								I still saved out of habit.<br>
								I was troubled if<br>
								I saved it all for my child<br>
								Things would never be scarce<br>
								And he would never save anything.<br><br>

								As the child grew,<br>
								He never looked upon me,<br>
								Synced instead of saving<br>
								The boy sat in a desk all day<br>
								No business etiquettes<br>
								Later that day<br>
								He went to the store<br>
								And brought me milk with cryptocurrency.<br><br>

								Two strangers! <br>

								Unaware of each other<br>
								unlike choices, that wouldn't change for anyone<br>
								separate ambitions yet to be dovetailed.<br>
								It was long before<br>

								Two faces<br>

								seemingly aware of each other's belongingness.<br>
								They exchanged a lot of<br>

								It was around then<br>
								God decided playing Dice with the Universe.<br>
								Two troubled souls<br>
								Dreams turning to nightmares.<br>
								Both could only smell a fishy business<br>
								with no apparent benefits, <br>
								Something else was enticing.<br>
								The moment Love turned to luxury, <br>
								God decided not to play Dice with the Universe.  <br><br>

                                        The fear crumbled forever<br>
