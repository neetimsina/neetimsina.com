							<h2>The Days of Mental Arithmetic</h2></center>
							<p>
								<img height="100%" width="100%" src="images/beads.jpg"></img>
								A few days back, I was calculating the subnet mask in the laboratory exam of Networking concepts when I realized my hands hovering up midair making some furious movements were catching an awkward attention of my friends including the invigilator. I had to stop and smile with oneself as it is not much of a new thing occurring to thousands of global UCMAS graduates like me. UCMAS stands for Universal Concept Of Mental Arithmetic System. In an initial outlook, the concept might look vague because of the sophisticated use of words but in reality this practice of arithmetic dates back to centuries before the modern computers were even not imagined. In fact, we are here talking about the first calculating device that originated in china with the name, abacus and it’s use to mental development of a child.<br><br>

								Though the Chinese discovered this primitive way of calculating, it was Malaysians who rejuvenated this technique today for uplifting the processing power, memory and logical reasoning of our mind. These days, this concept is widely used all over the world including Nepal. There are several Abacas academy in Nepal under the common wing of UCMAS, Nepal whose central office is in Kumaripati, Lalitpur. The national UCMAS competitions are held yearly in order to uplift the regular practice culture. Learning some mental arithmetic might look fictitious at first but the whole course is devised in such a way that you need not carry calculator with you for petty calculating tasks like changing money, solving basic equations and calculating the amount of money that are going to sum up in a shopping center.<br><br>
								
								I joined this Abacus academy when I was in my 6th grade and completed my graduation when I was in my 9th. They say I was already late for the program as the actual mental development stops at the age of 16. There are some really sound memories back from the days when I was in the institution. They taught us not only the art of using abacus for addition, subtractions, multiplications and divisions of some mere numbers but also the art of public speaking, mental reflexes, expressions of ones ideas and the science of concentration. I gradually found myself getting logical, calm, reflective and responsible after a certain period of running my fingers over those sacred amazing beads inside the black frameworks of abacus. I learnt that the real meaning of co- education is not just taking seat with an opposite gender nearby but also to value sound opinions of people who are younger than you. The regular abacus playing culture also made me understand the concept of repeated effort in real life scenarios.<br><br>
								
								The institutions under this abacus concept uses the basic neuro-science in order to explore the hidden capabilities of our mystical brain. It should be noted that, the regular use of one part of the body activates the exact opposite part of the human cerebrum, i.e the part that is responsible for intelligence. For example, we are right handed implies we are left minded and we are left handed implies we have unlocked the right part of our brain. Most of the people live with just one part of their brain all their life! But what if we can use both the part of our body and unlock impossible corners of memory, imagination and intelligence? This is where the Abacus comes in handy. We use both the hands equally with some mental concentration that helps activate neurons and make them grow. The cover of arithmetic veils too well the neurological part of UCMAS education here.<br><br>
								
								At first, we are made to shift the beads inside the framework of abacus. Later on, after much practice, we are able to visualize the abacus in our head and even feel the beads shifting while we start making mental calculations. I have seen people on horror while they enter my room on sudden and realize I have been making fanatic movements of my hands and fingers. They laugh out aloud when I make them clear about what I was up to. They get so carried away with the concept that they enroll their child the next week. But three years of dedication for something is not a joke and finally, upon seeing no immediate returns make their own child a dropout of the class and this amazing concept.<br><br>
								
								It takes a great effort to work something out of the blues. Joining something classic beyond the academics in Nepal is thus always a matter of self-determination and endurance. We shall remain only within our own mentality until we discover new practices and unfold unique perceptions. For this, we should take learning not as a risk of failure but as a window of opportunity. I wish this concept would grow and become mandatory for every interested child in Nepal.<br><br>

							<h2>Are you any different?</h2></center>
							<p>
								Everyone is same. With the same thing that interests the society and the same set up standard to maintain. All of us look the same, set similar ambitions, want the same thing out of situations, get the same insecurities and feel exactly the same. We don’t even set our aims independently, 10 years ago when you asked a child what you wanted to be, they would reply a doctor. Today, you ask a child the same question they will probably reply an artist or an entrepreneur.<br><br>

								Things won’t be getting better anytime soon. There are rarely a very few things you people have discovered yourself. All the life, you have spent on gathering recommendations. When you do the recommended tasks, you seek out social validations to make sure you are doing it the right way. Why can’t people understand that the recommendations were all based on past interests and even the past interest weren’t based on your freewill. Why can’t people understand there is no such thing as the right thing and wrong thing. It’s all about whether or not you like it. As per today, if the majority likes it, It becomes the right thing and if the mass doesn’t recognize it, it becomes a weird thing. You start getting questioned and out of despair you mix up with the herd and be one of them.<br><br>
								
								Oh where do I even stop! My friends all look the same because apparently they all believe in the fine sized eyebrows and the same shade of foundations. They even know how to twist the facial structure and get the standard frail look models get on Fashion TV. They have gathered all the punch line from the hyped movies and shows and now our talks have already been converted to some stage performance after a long rehearsal of some sort. We collect knowledge not to pass it not but rather not to miss out. Being updated is mandatory ain’t it?<br><br>
								
								And with this so predictable a world, what keeps you so fascinated to live, to achieve, to act a cooler dummy these days? What are the chances that you’ll get replaced by another person or even machine within a few hours? The point is, your life has been some organization of a sort and the CEO changes your functions or products based on the market requirement. How many of you changed yourself to be liked by some dumb-ass crushes you had in high school? Are they even there in your life? Are your parents who forced you to be spoon fed there to console you when you are frustrated by the hierarchy and bureaucracy at work? Please don’t be that. Please dream on your own. Please be you. We need you, not the one kind of personality you were imposed upon.<br><br>

							<h2>Away</h2></center>
							<p>
								Some days, maybe a week full of silence. Is that much to ask for? Point! Why do I even ask? Lights make me see the darkness, water burns my throat and I'm sure silence'll hurt my ears. That's way too surficial anyway. I have been deteriorating and I don't even want to stop it. Because I'm just a talker? Nah neppie nip. I want to feel what a six years old feel. That's not completely possible but I can try. I know too many things to be a six years old again. Knowing hurts but Ignorance causes me blisters. These things are all so vague.<br><br>

								As I reflect upon the place where I live, I find it to be a little insensitive to anything. I can't help but wonder about self worth shits implicted upon us. What are we worth? Just a pile of flesh and water, a little too scarlet to not exist. Vehicles cause me nausea. Pardon the last line, I'm a fool. I see the world as it is and it brings peace. "As it is" This already sounds like a cliche. Look around, The fuck we discovered things to make life easier. Everyone wishes to slit their wrists anytime soon. I can already smell a pi le of dead bodies. But the machines endure. They incinerate the bodies and yell "Here We declare, the words that closely resembles humane to be dead." The word Humanity starts to get underlined with red everafter. Serves you right motherfuckers.<br><br>

								But then, there is music. I think a good music is better than love. You don't expect a soulful music to like you back, it doesn't even know that it's redefining your life, giving you a slightest of reasons for not slitting your wrist, at least for Today. It's a kind of riskless devotion. Now I sound barbaric. But am I? I cry before sleep everyday. Sometimes for the trees they cut down to make contract papers. Othertimes for an artist who can't differentiate whether it's the lyrics or the beats that make people cry. Most of the times for being hard upon myself.<br><br>

								All these people around, are they real? I don't find them true to oneself. Neither am I, bunch of lies I call my life. Had I been brave, I would have written every truth that troubles me. But what good is that? For me, self loathing is a bit better than mass scorn. Back to people I jump. I feel like they are running for something, that same something which I am lazily waiting for. But are they, or me or you running for something or running away from something. The truth for instance? I don't know, I've hurt my head already.<br><br>

								At some point, I feel like slapping myself. Especially when I try to fit in the crowd with puns. I don't know if we really need human connections to survive. Maybe we need to tell somebody what we're doing and that somebody will feel precious being entrusted with this info. Is this the whole point of co-existence? We have even rated and priced these emotion dumping sites. We connect to a human with equivalent rating and dump our desperate lies. Yeah life is a waste of time.<br><br>

								<h2>On Humane Dilemmas</h2></center>
								<p>
									Look upon the petty nature of human life and wonder how bound we are to the enormous possibilities we limit after each of our conscious choices. Do we become more humane after taking utilitarian decisions or when we sacrifice our theories for someone else’s pre determined submissions to hormonal release and call it Love. Does it matter if we are successful because I find the early life of successful people deeply disturbing, even ridiculous to today’s understanding.
									<br><br>I think a human being is termed better than the other based on the number of lives he/she improves and motivates. I also noticed how this holds true only when he/she attains a global standard on success and perceives any future endeavours as a base understanding for improvement of community and it’s inhabitants. Is this possible that one raises a child who wouldn't feel obligated to these standardized version of love,loss and success? I would dream of people ready to risk it that way. As a rational thinker though, who wakes up every morning on getting rewarded for even the smallest investments, I would deny it already. “Let’s get everything going until something has to be done to keep it from not falling apart.” This sentence nips ideas in the buds.
									<br><br>I have a problem with my evolutionary traits. Are we exhibiting as per the program or we just the part of that anomaly no one notices during their exceptionally short life span. Anything could have been possible. It could mean the beginning of something we could build on or the down faced loaf of buttered bread some master just dropped on carpet earth, We get egoistic on our germination and term it a breakthrough. It could just have been the season of another till our our fate destined to dry out of disembodiment with the roots. But as always, we all have problems with a lot more things and my concern over evolutionary traits would be of least importance. Here ends my brief monologue and the summary enslaving these tiring two decades of thinking about growing into a healthy plant out of a breadloaf.
